        <h1>HOW TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE RESUME</h1>
        <div class="textbox"><p>What is a resume?</p> <br>
            <p class="text">A resume, also known as a CV (curriculum vitae), is a formal document presenting your professional qualifications to secure a job. It highlights essential skills, education, notable accomplishments, and relevant work experience, creating a compelling snapshot of your background and abilities, increasing your chances of getting hired. Resume writing doesn’t have to be hard if you have the right tools and the best resume formats at your fingertips.

                While your ultimate goal with a resume is to get a job, the first purpose it serves is to attract enough attention to get you an interview. Recruiters may go through hundreds of resumes and only pick a few to interview. A well-written and well-formatted resume gets your foot in the door so you can wow them with your communication and personal interview skills.
                
                No matter what type of resume layout you choose, it should be a snapshot of your relevant life and work experience, skills and communication ability. Think of your resume as a one-page advertisement, and you are the product. Combined with a well-written cover letter, your resume gets you through the door for the job.</p>

        <div class="textbox"><p>Why is a good resume important?</p>
            <p class="text">When it comes to searching for a job, your resume is the first place you should start to build a solid base. A good resume is important for many reasons, including:

                It sells your strongest accomplishments and skills
                It catches the attention of recruiters and employers
                It shows why you match the project or position
                It helps you get a job interview, where you can sell your skills in person
                Depending on the job, a hiring recruiter or manager receives hundreds to thousands of applications for every open spot within their companies. Resumes are the tool they use to narrow down candidates and determine which ones deserve a face-to-face interview. They are often short on time and look for ways to quickly find solid candidates for each job.
                
                A resume can help you land your dream job if it’s written correctly. If you outline your relevant experience and skills, display what unique benefits you offer to the company and match yourself to the position, you grab the employer’s attention. Focus on what makes you different than other candidates and what you offer that no one else can.
                
                Even if your resume doesn’t lead to the job you are applying for now, a memorable resume can be pulled up later when another position opens.</p>
           
            <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i></div>
        <div class="textbox"><p>What does a good resume include?</p>
            <p class="text">Personal details
                At the very least, the personal details section should include your email address, name and phone number. You may also choose to include a link to a website or portfolio, depending on the job. If you have a LinkedIn account, include that along with any relevant social media accounts.
                
                LinkedIn is the biggest global network for professionals and most recruiters expect that applicants have a profile. Before you add your profile to your resume, take some time to look it over and update information, include a professional photo and remove any inappropriate material.
                
                The same rules apply to any social media profiles your potential employer wants to see. Most often, recruiters use social media searches only to see how you’ll fit into the company culture. In some roles, your online “brand” is crucial to your job. We suggest that you only use social media profiles that apply to your desired job. 
                
                There’s no need to include personal information such as your date of birth or any personal identification number. If you make it further in the hiring process, the recruiter can ask you for additional identifying information. In Canada and the United States, adding a photo on your resume may hurt your chances of getting an interview because of strict discrimination laws and employment policies.</p>

        <div class="textbox"><p>How to make a resume?</p>
            <p class="text">A resume should include personal information, an objective or summary statement, work experience, education, and hard and soft skills. If you have room left over, include languages, achievements and awards, extracurricular activities, and hobbies and interests. Only include references if the company asks for them.

                Many software programs come with built-in resumes, so there are many ways to make a resume online. Two of the most popular tools used for creating resumes are Microsoft Word and Google Docs. However, while these tools are useful, they do have their disadvantages.
                
                One of the main drawbacks of using Microsoft Word or Google Docs to create your resume is that it can be time-consuming to get the formatting just right. Another downside is that many of the formats lack originality and won’t help you stand out. The chances of other applicants using the same format as yours are high when you use programs such as Google or Microsoft.
                
                A resume builder is a better option if you want to be assured your resume is polished and up to date with the latest trends. A resume builder like Jobseeker offers a wide variety of interactive, easy to use resume templates that help you meet your ultimate goal: to stand out in the application process.</p>
